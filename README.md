# This is a simple gopher protcol server written in golang!   
-------
This server is really simply but it works well for the gopher protocl it has a simple json config where youc can set the IP and the port of where you want the server to listen.   
The root directory can also be configured from here. I am currently running this server at gopher://geogory.space so check it out if you can!

# In the works!

I am currently working on an application to make gophermaps for you so you don't have to manually config gopher maps for each dir.
