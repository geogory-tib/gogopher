  As any of you who may know me, know that I am trying to learn how to code. One of the things I find myself not doing much is networking stuff
,as a result I decided that I would try to make a server for the gopher protocol! I thought about doing gemini, but the idea of a plaintext network
protcol seemed interesting to me. I tend to hate using the internet due to it's huge bloat that even the simpliest of websites have anymore. With gopher
this doesn't exist, it's as simple as it can be and it retains a lot of the spark the old internet people seem to talk about a lot (I wasn't alive back then).
I really do enjoy looking at these gopherspaces, it's neat what people do with them, I've even seen some people do dynamic sites somehow?


  I though about eventually rewriting this server in odin or c so I can embed lua into this, so the server could run scripts to kind of add some sort of dynamic
text injection to the gophermenus or what not. I still need to perfect this server so, that won't be for a while. My gopher server is good enough for basic stuff
but for some reason my client won't download images I send from my server? Not sure exactly what's going on but I will have to test it on some other binary formats.
I am also probably missing some other things from the offical spec I need to implement. the server right now is setting at like 150ish lines of code,
which isn't a lot but it still works!

Anyways have a nice night
